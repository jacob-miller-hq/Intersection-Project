# Intersection-Project
A deep learning project aimed at increasing the efficiency of intersections in the future.

I am hoping to mimick some of Google DeepMind's tech (obviously on a much smaller scale) in order to safely control a virtual intersection
in which all cars surrender control as they approach. I'm hoping to create an algorithm that can run even the most busy of intersections
safely and efficiently.
